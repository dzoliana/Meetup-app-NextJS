# Meetup-app

## Project summary

Meetup-app is a web application that represents an exercise in learning NextJS.
The focus is on creating new meetups, sending them to some backend and saving them in the database.

## About Next

- NextJS is defined as "React framework for production applications".
  - Framework: Because there are many possibilities, clear rules.
  - React: It's a framework for React, because it builds on React, improves it. You still write React code and build React components
  - Production: It's a production framework because it adds all those missing features that you usually have to add to React apps to really get them ready for production and solve common problems.
- Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js, specifically designed for server-rendered React applications.
- This framework emphasizes performance and the importance of static content optimization.

### Server-side Rendering (SSR) in React:

- server-side rendering (SSR) refers to the preparation of page content on the server instead of the client
- with classic React, there are problems with initial loading and the visual effect of "flickering" (loading state)
  - React is a client side JS library and rendering of html happens on the client side
  - The Html code that is sent from the server to the client when the user visits the page is quite empty
  - Because fetching happens when the JS code is executed on the client
- Difficulties with search engine optimization (SEO) due to an empty HTML page.
- The need to pre-render pages on the server, especially when retrieving data.
  - If that page was pre-rendered on the server, if that data retrieval could somehow be done on the server, when the request hits that server, then the finished page would be served to our users.
  - Then users would not have a loading state and the browser would see the content of our page.

### Integration of SSR in NextJS:

- React has built-in features for SSR, but with additional configuration.
- NextJS automatically applies SSR to pages without additional user setup.

### Why Next?

- Single page app (SPA) is an application that is not served from a new HTML page every time new content needs to be displayed, but is dynamically generated by JavaScript manipulating the DOM.
- Because there is no need to load a new HTML page every time something needs to be changed.
- Search engine optimization (SEO) is the activity of optimizing your website in order to get more organic traffic from search engines.
- The problem with SEO in SPA is that search engines cannot properly index the application, which is different from server-side applications. The SPA only serves the initial HTML file, so search engines can't index the content because in a single page application you have JavaScript generating new HTML every time something changes.
- Although SPAs have many other advantages such as performance, time and bandwidth savings, better responsiveness on mobile devices, increased performance on slower internet connections, etc.
- With server-side rendered applications, especially with Next.js, you can create an efficient application and have good SEO at the same time.

## Getting started

_React + Next_

The React app dev server is started via "npm run dev".
